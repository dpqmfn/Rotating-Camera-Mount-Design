# 360-Degree-Rotating-Camera-Mount-Design 
A 3D Printable 360-Degree Rotating Tracking Camera System Design for Mobile Robots (Designed for Realsense D455 Camera & Dynamixel XM430-W210-T Actuator) 

This project features a simple and practical 3D printable CAD design for a mobile robot camera tracking system. It combines the Intel RealSense D455 camera with the Dynamixel XM430-W210-T servo motor, providing a flexible and adjustable solution for applications like object tracking and SLAM.

Key Features
Camera Platform: A custom-designed platform that securely holds the Intel RealSense D455 camera in place for optimal tracking and performance.
Motor Mount: A dedicated mount for the Dynamixel XM430-W210-T servo motor, ensuring smooth and precise control for 2D camera tracking on the x-y plane.
Aligned Rotation: The center of the servo’s rotation is perfectly aligned with the front face of the RealSense camera, allowing for accurate and synchronized movement.
3D Printable: All components are designed to be 3D printed, making it easy to prototype and integrate into your robotic system.

What’s Included
STEP Files: Camera_Platform.step, Motor_Mount.step  – Fully editable CAD files for customization.
STL Files: Camera_Platform.stl, Motor_Mount.stl – Ready-to-print models for 3D printing.
