# Rotating-Camera-Mount-Design
A simple 3D Printable CAD Design for Mobile Robot Tracking System (Realsense D455 Camera &amp; Dynamixel XM430-W210-T Actuator)

This project features a simple and practical 3D printable CAD design for a mobile robot camera tracking system. It combines the Intel RealSense D455 camera with the Dynamixel XM430-W210-T servo motor, providing a flexible and adjustable solution for applications like object tracking and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

Key Features
Camera Platform: A custom-designed platform that securely holds the Intel RealSense D455 camera in place for optimal tracking and performance.
Motor Mount: A dedicated mount for the Dynamixel XM430-W210-T servo motor, ensuring smooth and precise control for 2D camera tracking on the x-y plane.
Aligned Rotation: The center of the servo’s rotation is perfectly aligned with the front face of the RealSense camera, allowing for accurate and synchronized movement.
3D Printable: All components are designed to be 3D printed, making it easy to prototype and integrate into your robotic system.

What’s Included
STEP Files: Camera_Platform.step, Motor_Mount.step  – Fully editable CAD files for customization.
STL Files: Camera_Platform.stl, Motor_Mount.stl – Ready-to-print models for 3D printing.

Applications
Mobile Robot Navigation: Ideal for tracking and following objects in real-time, contributing to your robot's overall navigation system.
SLAM: Use the tracking system as part of a camera-based solution for robot localization and mapping.
Prototyping and Research: A versatile design for developing and testing camera tracking systems in robotics.

Design Process
This design was created with both precision and simplicity in mind. The camera platform holds the Intel RealSense D455 securely, while the motor mount ensures smooth, precise control of the camera. The servo’s rotation axis is perfectly aligned with the front of the camera for seamless tracking. Everything is designed for 3D printing, allowing you to easily modify the system to suit your needs.
